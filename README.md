# BookmarkHive

## Pitch 

It's a decentralized social bookmarking service based on the Activity Pub protocol.

Each bookmark is also a snapshot of the page at a specific point in time, 
similar to how the Internet Archive works.

The goal is twofold: to save bookmarks and archive the given page, 
all in a decentralized manner for greater resilience.

## Development steps

- Simple API with a browser extension **(current step)**
- Implementation of the Activity Pub protocol (including an administration interface for managing reports)
- Addition of end-to-end encryption for private bookmarks
