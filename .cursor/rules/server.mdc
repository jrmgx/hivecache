This project has multiples parts:
 - API with openapi attributes under `server/src/Api/*`
 - Admin with EasyAdmin under `server/src/Admin/*`
 - ActivityPub server under `server/src/ActivityPub/*`

They all use the same entities, and they must all respect the rules described below.

# Rules

- Use PHP 8.4 syntax
- Use last Symfony version
- Use attributes when possible, prefer attribute over config files
- Do not remove debug code unless asked to:
  - `$this->client->enableProfiler();` is to be considered as debug code
  - `dump` and `dd` as well

# Testing

In test mode we have we have two servers:
 - First: the current code (we should use httpkernel requests), this is what we want to run our assertions against
 - Second: `external_ap_server.test` that is a black box, still it runs the same code but we can not access its database or anything (we must use api endpoint with a real httpclient). It is used to test ActivityPub endpoint when we need for our tests a second source (used for server to server interactions)
