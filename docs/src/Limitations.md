# Limitations

## Trust and Security

Since bookmark content is generated by the client, it can be manipulated.<br>
Trust in the client software is required.

> [!TIP]
> To mitigate this issue, the client can be easily installed independently of the server.

Since the server is managed by an administrator, it can be manipulated.<br>
Trust in the server administrator is required.

> [!TIP]
> To mitigate this issue, encryption is coming to protect your private bookmarks.

## Tag Limitations

- Maximum 1000 tags per user
- Tag normalization: emojis are stripped, normalized slugs used for matching
  - Example: "🐘 PHP" = "PHP" = "php" (all treated as the same tag)
  - Tags that are only emojis cannot be created

## Extension Capture

Page capturing is best-effort. Known limitations:
- You must keep the popup open during capture
- YouTube pages may be broken (other sites too)
- Videos are not captured
- External fonts are not captured
- Basic auth protected pages may not be captured
- Future improvements may include: video capture for YouTube, code archives for GitHub, etc.

## ActivityPub

HiveCache implements a limited subset of the ActivityPub protocol,
focused on enabling communication between multiple HiveCache instances.

For example, POST to Outbox is not, and won't be, implemented.

### Limited Implementation Scope

The goal of this implementation is not to be fully compatible with all the fediverse
but mostly to allow multiple instances of HiveCache to communicate together.

### What HiveCache Does NOT Support

- Replies, threads and conversations
- Favorites and bookmarking (in the ActivityPub sense)
- Accepting/rejecting following requests (see note below)
- Showing followers list
- Sending any notifications

> [!NOTE]
> In HiveCache implementation, there is not much of a follower concept - followers do not show in the official client.
> That's why there is no accept/reject concept either.
> There are no notifications about a new follower either.
> **This may evolve in the future.**

## Client Behavior

- Multiple tag layouts: When multiple tags with different layouts are selected, the chosen layout is unpredictable.

## Public/Private Bookmark Behavior

> [!WARNING]
> Once a bookmark is set to public, you cannot change it back to private.
> If you re-capture it as private, both versions will remain public.

> [!NOTE]
> The reverse is not true: making a private bookmark public doesn't make previous versions public, but all subsequent versions will be public.
